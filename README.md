## Lane Line Detection
Detecting Lane lines is one of the most fundamental concepts for building a Self Driving Car. In this repository, I have used OpenCV to detect lane lines in a sample video sample obtained from a camera places on a car.

You need OpenCV to run this project on your local machine and it can be installed simply by a single command - <br>
```pip install opencv-python```

## How to run
1. Download/Clone the repo.
2. Make sure you have OpenCV installed for Python.(I recommend installing it on top of Anaconda Distribution)
3. Execute the **lanes.py** script
```bash
python lanes.py
```
4. Make changes accordingly to use any other video file you might want to.(You can also use a static image, I have commented the image code since video is more useful.)
